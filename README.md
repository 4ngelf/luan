Neovim as a lua interpreter.

## Usage

luan interface is 100% compatible with the regular lua executable. That means you can use it as
a direct replacement as long as neovim is available on the system.

```sh
usage: luan [options] [script [args]].
Available options are:
  -e statement      execute string 'statement'
  -l name           require library 'name'
  -i,--interactive  enters interactive mode after running script
  -h,--help         show this help
  -v,--version      show version information
  --                stop handling options
  -                 execute stdin and stop handling options
```
